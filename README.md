# dot-files
Random dot-files that I made. I personally don't think that you should use them, as I am neither a very good programmer nor a consistent person.
If you happen to like these and decide to use them anyways, I would recommend not checking back here.

# Dependencies
* rofi
* dunst
* waybar
* udiskie
* swww
* wlogout
* trizen
  
There are defaults such as the browser being set to Librewolf and various others that you don't *need*, but not changing these or not installing can cause issues, so I would recommend reading what you're downloading.

# Installation
Run ./install in your terminal. This script copies everything into '${HOME}/.config/' and creates a backup of any files that it may have overridden.
