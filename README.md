# dot-files
random dot-files that I made. I personally don't think that you should use them, as I am neither a very good programmer nor a consistent person.
If you happen to like these and decide to use them anyways, I would recommend not checking back here.

# installation
run ./install in your terminal. This script copies everything into '${HOME}/.config/' and creates a backup of any files that it may have overridden.
